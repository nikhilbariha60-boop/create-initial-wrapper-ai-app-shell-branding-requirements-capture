# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a link sharing feature to the Wrapper AI website with a Copy Link button and social share options for WhatsApp, Facebook, and Twitter/X.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a Link Share component with a "Copy Link" button that copies the current page URL to the clipboard and shows a "Copied!" confirmation for 2 seconds
- Add social share buttons for WhatsApp, Facebook, and Twitter/X that open the respective platform's share dialog in a new tab with the current page URL pre-filled
- Place the Link Share component in a prominent, accessible location (e.g., header or floating share bar) so it is visible on all pages without scrolling
- Ensure the component is responsive and works on both mobile and desktop layouts

**User-visible outcome:** Users can easily share any page of the site via a copy link button or by directly sharing to WhatsApp, Facebook, or Twitter/X from a visible share component accessible on every page.
